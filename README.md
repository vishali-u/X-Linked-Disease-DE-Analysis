**A1**: https://github.com/vishali-u/bcb420/blob/main/a1/a1_VishaliUmaiyalan.html
  * Dataset selection and normalization
  * Chosen data set: [GSE126712](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126712)
  * Publication: [_Integrated functional genomic analyses of Klinefelter and Turner syndromes reveal global network effects of altered X chromosome dosage_](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1910003117)
  * Published on February 18, 2020
  * 55 individuals: 14 females with Turner syndrome (X0), 14 males with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), 13 male controls, and 14 female controls

**A2**: https://github.com/vishali-u/bcb420/blob/main/a2/a2_VishaliUmaiyalan.html
  * Differential gene expression analysis and over-representation analysis
  * Control females vs. females with Turner syndrome (TS)
      * 198 significant differentially expressed genes after multiple testing correction (significance threshold: 0.05)
  * Control males vs. males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS)
      * 19 significant differentially expressed genes after multiple testing correction (significance threshold: 0.05)

**A3**: https://github.com/vishali-u/bcb420/blob/main/a3/a3_VishaliUmaiyalan.html
  * Data set pathway and network analysis
  * Only used results from control females vs. females with TS 
  * Non-threshold gene set enrichment analysis using the GSEA software
  * Generated enrichment map using Cytoscape
